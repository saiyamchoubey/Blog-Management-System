## 📝 Problem Statement  

Managing blogs online often requires features like creating posts, editing content, commenting, and ensuring that only authorized users can modify their own work. Many beginners also struggle to understand how to implement **CRUD operations**, **authentication**, and **authorization** in a real-world application.  

This project aims to solve these problems by building a **Blog Management System** using **Spring Boot**, which allows:  

- Users to create, read, update, and delete their own blog posts.  
- Visitors to view blogs and comments without registration.  
- Registered users to comment on any blog.  
- Role-based access control using **Spring Security** so that users can only edit/delete their own posts.  
- A simple, user-friendly frontend with **Thymeleaf templates**.  

👉 In short: *“The project provides a beginner-friendly blogging platform that demonstrates how to build a secure, full-stack web application using Spring Boot.”*
